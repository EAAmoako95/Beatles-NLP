If the rain comes
they run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes
When the sun shines
they slip into the shade
and sip their lemonade
When the sun shines
When the sun shines
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
I can show you
that when it starts to rain
everything's the same
I can show you
I can show you
Rain, I don't mind
Shine, the weather's fine
Can you hear me
that when it rains and shines
it's just a state of mind
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
