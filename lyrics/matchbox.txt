I said I'm sitting here watching
matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
but I sure got a long way to go
I'm an old poor boy
I'm a long way from home
I'm an old poor boy
and I'm a long way from home
I've never been happy
cause everything I ever did was wrong
Well, if you don't want my peaches
honey please don't shake my tree
If you don't want any of those peaches
honey, please don't mess around my tree
I've got news for you baby
Leave me here in misery, all right!
Well let me be your little dog
till your big dog comes
Let me be your little dog
till your big dog comes
And when your big dog gets here
watch how your puppy dog runs
Well I said I'm sitting here watching
matchbox hole in my clothes
I said I'm sitting here wondering
matchbox hole in my clothes
I ain't got no matches
but I sure got a long way to go
