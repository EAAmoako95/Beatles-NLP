Well you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good looking
But she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag
dressed in a polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
Yeh, yeh, yeh
Get a dose of her in jackboot and kilt
She's killer diller when
she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
that makes the news of the world
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Yeh, yeh, yeh
