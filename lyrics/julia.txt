Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia,
Julia, Julia
ocean child calls me
So I sing a song of love
Julia
Julia
Seashell eyes, windy smile calls me
So I sing a song of love
Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering
Glimmering in the sun
Julia, Julia
Morning moon touch me
So I sing a song of love
Julia
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind
Julia
Julia
Sleeping sand, silent cloud touch me
So I sing a song of love
Julia
Hum, calls me
So I sing a song of love for
Julia, Julia, Julia
