I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
she's just the girl for me
and I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Had it been another day
I might have looked the other way
and I'd have never been aware
but as it is I'll dream of her tonight
La la la la la la
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again
I have never known the like of this
I've been alone and I have missed things
and kept out of sight
for other girls were never quite like this
Da da da da da da
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again
Yeah, pa pa pa pa
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again
I've just seen a face
I can't forget the time or place where we just met
she's just the girl for me
and I want all the world to see we've met
Mm mm mm mm mm mm
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again
Falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again
Oh, falling, yes I am falling
And she keeps calling
me back again
