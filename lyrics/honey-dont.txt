Well, how come you say you will when you won't?
Say you do, baby when you don't
Let me know, honey, how you fell
Tell the truth now, is love real?

Well, honey don't
Well, honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
Honey don't
I say you will when you won't
aw, aw, honey don't
Well, I love you, baby, and you ought to know
I like the way that you wear your clothes
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
You got that sand all over your feet

Uh huh, baby been stepping around

Aw, aw, honey don't
