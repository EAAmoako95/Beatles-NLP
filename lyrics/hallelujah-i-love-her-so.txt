Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,
She's my baby and I love her so.
Every morning when the sun comes up,
She brings me coffee in my favourite cup.
Then I know, yes I know,
Hallelujah, I just love her so.

When I call her on the telephone,
"Hear me, baby, I'm all alone."
Before I'm countin' from one to four
She'll be knocking on the door.

In the evening when the sun goes down,
And there ain't nobody else around.
She kisses me and then she holds me tight,
Says, "Baby, everything's alright".
That's why I know, that's why I know,
Hallelujah, I just love her so.
Hallelujah, I just love her so.
Hallelujah, I just love that chick so.
