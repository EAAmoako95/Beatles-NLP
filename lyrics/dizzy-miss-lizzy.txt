You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
The way you rock and roll
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
When we do the stroll
Come on Miss Lizzy
Love me 'fore I grow too old
Come on, give me fever
put your little hand in mine
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy
oh, girl you look so fine
Just a rocking and a rolling
Girl I said I wish you were mine, ah
Ooh, ah
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
When you call my name
Ooo, baby
Say you're driving me insane
Come on, come on, come on, come on baby
I want to be your loving man, Ah
Run and tell your mama
I want you be my bride
Run and tell your brother
Baby don't run and hide
You make me dizzy Miss Lizzy
Girl I want to marry you
Come on, give me fever
put your little hand in mine, girl
You make me dizzy dizzy Lizzy
Girl you look so fine
You're just a rocking and a rolling
Ooo I said I wish you were mine, ah
