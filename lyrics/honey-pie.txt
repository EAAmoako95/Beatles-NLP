She was a working girl
North of England way
Now she's in the big time
In the USA
And if she could only hear me
this is what I'd say
Honey pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please home
Oh, Honey Pie
My position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
of you Hollywood song
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the though of meeting you
makes me weak in the knee
Oh, honey pie
You are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
kindly send her sailing back to me
T. T. Tee, Now honey pie
You are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
Son won't you please come home
Honey pie, come back to me
Come, come back to me, Honey pie
ha, ha, ha
Honey pie, honey pie
