I want a love that's right
Right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short-haired girl
who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you
Pick me up from where
some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
replacing every thoughtless frown
So escaping from this zoo
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
it won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you'll say
I'll live and love and maybe some day
who knows baby, you may comfort me, heh
I may appear to be imperfect
my love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster that the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows baby, you may comfort me
I know my love is yours to miss
that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late
For you sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
it won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here
it won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Tu la, tu ru tu
