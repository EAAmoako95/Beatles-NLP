A taste of honey
tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du
I dream of your first kiss and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey
A taste of honey
tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey, and you
Do dut don du, to dut don du
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still though we're far apart
A taste of honey
A taste of honey
tasting much sweeter than wine
Do dut don du, do dut don du
