You don't realize how much I need you
Love you all the time and never leave you
Please come on back to me
I'm lonely as can be
I need you
Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me
I didn't realize
As I looked in you eyes
You told be
Oh, yes you told me
you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
Oh, yes you told me
you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me
And feeling like this
I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So come on back and see
Just what you mean to me
I need you
I need you
I need you
