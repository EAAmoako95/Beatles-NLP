Not guilty
for getting in your way
while you're trying to steal the day.
Not guilty
and I'm not here for the rest,
I'm not trying to steal your vest.

I am not trying to be smart,
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry for your ageing head.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.

No use handing me a writ
while I'm trying to do my bit.

I don't expect to take your heart.
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry that you're underfed.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.

Not guilty
for looking like a freak,
making friends with every Sikh.
Not guilty
for leading you astray
on the road to Mandalay.

I won't upset the apple cart.
I only want what I can get.
I'm really sorry that you've been misled.
But like you heard me said:
not guilty.
