Because you're sweet and lovely girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely girl, It's true
I love you more that ever girl, I do
I want you in the morning girl, I love you
I want you at the moment, I feel blue
I'm living every moment girl, for you
Walk, walk cat walk
Go Johnny go
Same ole 12-bar blues
(Elmore James go nothin' on this baby)
I loved you from the moment I saw you
You looket at me, that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
I'm having the blues
