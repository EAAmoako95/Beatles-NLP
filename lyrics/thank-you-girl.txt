Ah, ah, mm, you be good to me
you made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
I could tell the world
a thing or two about love
I know little girl on ly a fool
would doubt our love
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Thank you girl for lovin' me the way that you do
(way that you do)
That's the kind of love that is too good to be true
Al all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Ah, ah, mm, you be good to me
you made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
in love with you
And all I gotta do is thank you girl
Thank you girl
Ah, ah, ah
