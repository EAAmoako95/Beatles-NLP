We said our good-byes
Love was in your eyes
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before
Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before, yeah
Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry
We said our good-byes
Love was in your eyes
Now today I find
You have changed your mind
Treat me like you did the night before, yes
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Last night is the night I will remember you by
When I think of things we did
It makes me wanna cry
Were you telling lies?
Was I so unwise
When I held you near
You were so sincere
Treat me like you did the night before
Like the night before
