Martha my dear
though I spend my days in conversation
please remember me
Martha my love don't forget me
Martha my dear
Hold you head up you silly girl
look what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl take a good look around you
Take a good look you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be
for each other silly girl
Hold your hand out you silly girl
see what you've done
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Martha my dear
you have always been my inspiration
please remember me
Martha my love don't forget me
Martha my dear
