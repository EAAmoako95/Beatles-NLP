My baby says she's traveling
on the one after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once
Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
I said I'm traveling
on the one after 909
I begged her not to go
and I begged her on my bended knees
You're only fooling around
You're only fooling around with me
I said move over once
Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
I said I'm traveling
on the one after 909
I've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location
Picked up my bags, run right home
Then I find I've got the number wrong
Well, I said I'm traveling
on the one after 909
I said move over honey
I'm traveling on that line
I said move over once
Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice
I've got my bag, run to the station
Railman says you've got the wrong location (yeah)
Picked up my bags, run right home (run right home)
Then I find I've got the number wrong

Move over twice
Come on baby, don't be cold as ice

on the one after 909
