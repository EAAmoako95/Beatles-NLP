All through the day
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
All through the night
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Mow they're frightened of leaving it
Everyone's reading it
comin' on strong all the time
All through the day
I me mine
I me me mine, I me me mine
I me me mine
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely that wine
All through the day
I me mine
I me me mine, I me me mine
I me me mine
All I can hear
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
Even those tears
I me mine, I me mine, I me mine
No one's frightened of playing it
Everyone's saying it
Flowing more freely that wine
All through the life
I me mine
