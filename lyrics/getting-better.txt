It's getting better all the time
I used to get mad at my school
The teachers that taught me weren't cool
You're holding me down
Burning me round
filling me up with the rules
I've got to admit it's getting better
a little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
it's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave m the word
I finally heard
I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better
a little better all the time
I have to admit it's getting better
it's getting better since you've been mine
getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
better, better, better
I used to be cruel to my woman I beat her
and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
and I'm doing the best that I can
I've got to admit it's getting better
a little better all the time
Yes, admit it's getting better
it's getting better since you've been mine
getting so much better all the time
It's getting better all the time
better, better, better
It's getting better all the time
better, better, better
Getting so much better all the time
