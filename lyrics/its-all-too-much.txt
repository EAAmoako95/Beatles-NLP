It's all too much
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes
You love is there for me
And the more I go inside
the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
the love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time
form life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are
or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
the love that's shining all around you
All the world is birthday cake
so take a piece but not too much
Sell me on a silver sun
where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere
and get me home for tea
It's all too much for me to see
the love that's shining all around you
The more I learn, the less I know
and what I do it's all too much
It's all too much for me to take
the love that's shining all around you
Everywhere it's what you make for us to take
it's all too much
It's all too much
It's all too much
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
With your long blonde hair and your eyes of blue
You're too much
