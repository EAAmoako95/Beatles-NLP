If you wear red tonight
Remember what I said tonight
For red is color that my baby wore
and what's more it's true
Yes it is
Scarlet were clothes she wore
Everybody know I'm sure
I would remember all the things planned
understand it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, Oh, yes it is, yeh
Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
in spite of you it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is
I could be happy with you by my side
If I could forget her, but it's my pride
Yes it is, Oh, yes it is, yeh
Please don't wear red tonight
This is what I said tonight
For red is the color that will make me blue
in spite of you it's true
Yes it is, it's true
Yes it is, it's true
