I don't like you
But I love you
See that I'm always
thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh,
you treat me badly
I love you madly
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby
I don't want you,
but I need you
Don't want to kiss you
but I need you
Oh, oh, oh
you do me wrong now
my love is strong now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby
I love you and all I want you to do
is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
I want to leave you
don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me, baby
I love you and all I want you to do
is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
You really got a hold on me
You really got a hold on me
