In the morning light I feel so free
With the sun shining bright, just you and me
Walking hand in hand, down a road of dreams
With every step we take, it seems like we're living in a scene
Oh, we're walking on sunshine, and the sky is so blue
With the breeze blowing softly, it feels like we're flying too
And the world is so bright, when we're together, it's true
Oh, we're walking on sunshine, living life like it's new
In the fields of gold, we laugh and we play
With the flowers and the trees, it feels like a perfect day
We dance and we sing, to the rhythm of our hearts
With every beat and every note, it feels like we're never apart
Oh, we're walking on sunshine, and the sky is so blue
With the breeze blowing softly, it feels like we're flying too
And the world is so bright, when we're together, it's true
Oh, we're walking on sunshine, living life like it's new
With every smile and every kiss, it feels like a dream come true
And every moment we spend, together it's all brand new
Oh, we're walking on sunshine, and the sky is so blue
With the breeze blowing softly, it feels like we're flying too
And the world is so bright, when we're together, it's true
Oh, we're walking on sunshine, living life like it's new
And when the night falls and the stars shine bright
We'll be walking on sunshine, into the endless night.
