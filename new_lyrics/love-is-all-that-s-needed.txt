In a world that's so complex, and filled with pain
We search for something, that can ease our strain
And as we journey through life, with every step we take
We find that the answer, is love that we make
All we need is love, to light up the way
With a heart that's so pure, we'll find peace each day
With love in our hearts, we'll conquer all fear
And we'll know that in this world, love is all we need here
With every smile, and every gentle touch
Love has a way, of healing us so much
And as we give love, it returns tenfold
With love in our lives, we'll never grow old
All we need is love, to light up the way
With a heart that's so pure, we'll find peace each day
With love in our hearts, we'll conquer all fear
And we'll know that in this world, love is all we need here
Let us spread love, and kindness all around
And make the world brighter, with love that we've found
All we need is love, to light up the way
With a heart that's so pure, we'll find peace each day
With love in our hearts, we'll conquer all fear
And we'll know that in this world, love is all we need here
So let's embrace love, with open hearts and smiles
And know that in this world, love is all we need to find!
