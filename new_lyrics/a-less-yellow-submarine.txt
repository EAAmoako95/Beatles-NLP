Sailing under the sea, in a metal machine
Exploring the unknown, in the deep blue marine
Through the currents and waves, we journey on
In this submarine, we'll never be alone
Diving in the ocean, exploring all we can see
With the submarines, we'll conquer the deep blue sea
With every dive, we discover new mysteries
In the underwater world, we'll make our own histories
Gliding through the depths, with lights shining bright
With every mile we travel, we're venturing into the night
Watching schools of fish, and creatures of the sea
In this metal vessel, we're living so carefree
Diving in the ocean, exploring all we can see
With the submarines, we'll conquer the deep blue sea
With every dive, we discover new mysteries
In the underwater world, we'll make our own histories
Through the endless ocean, we'll journey on and on
With submarines, we'll never be gone
Diving in the ocean, exploring all we can see
With the submarines, we'll conquer the deep blue sea
With every dive, we discover new mysteries
In the underwater world, we'll make our own histories
And when the mission's done, and we return to shore
We'll remember all the wonders, that the ocean has in store.
