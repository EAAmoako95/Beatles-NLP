It's that time of year, when the world comes alive
With the sounds of joy, and the twinkling of lights
The air is so crisp, and the snow falls down
And the spirit of Christmas, can be felt all around
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the laughter and cheer, ringing in our ears
It's a season of love, and a season of peace
And a time to be grateful, for all that we share and believe
In the homes and the streets, the carolers sing
With the songs of the season, their voices take wing
And the children are giddy, with excitement and glee
As they dream of the gifts, under the tree
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the laughter and cheer, ringing in our ears
It's a season of love, and a season of peace
And a time to be grateful, for all that we share and believe
Let us spread love, and kindness all around
And make the world brighter, with love that we've found
It's the most wonderful time of the year
With the laughter and cheer, ringing in our ears
It's a season of love, and a season of peace
And a time to be grateful, for all that we share and believe
So let's embrace the season, with open hearts and smiles
And make this Christmas, the best one in miles!
