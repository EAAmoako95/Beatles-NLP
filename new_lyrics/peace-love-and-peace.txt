In a world that's filled with chaos and strife
We search for a beacon, to lead us to life
With love in our hearts, we'll conquer all fear
With peace in our minds, we'll spread it far and near
Peace and love, it's what we all need
With these words, we'll plant the seeds
Of a world that's filled with harmony and glee
Where everyone can live in peace and love, you'll see
From the mountains high, to the valleys below
We'll sing out this message, for all to know
That peace and love, is what we need the most
And together we'll build a world that's close
Peace and love, it's what we all need
With these words, we'll plant the seeds
Of a world that's filled with harmony and glee
Where everyone can live in peace and love, you'll see
Let us spread this message, to every land and sea
With peace and love, we'll set our spirits free
Peace and love, it's what we all need
With these words, we'll plant the seeds
Of a world that's filled with harmony and glee
Where everyone can live in peace and love, you'll see
With peace and love, we'll make a brighter day
In a world that's filled with peace and love, we'll find our way.
